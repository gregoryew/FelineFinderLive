# Git Setup Complete! ðŸŽ‰

Your Feline Finder Organization Portal project is now under Git version control.

## What was set up:

âœ… **Git repository initialized** in the project root  
âœ… **Comprehensive .gitignore** created to exclude:
   - `node_modules/` directories
   - Firebase build files and logs
   - Environment variables
   - IDE files
   - OS-specific files
   - Build outputs

âœ… **Initial commit created** with all project files (90 files, 39,729 lines)

## Useful Git Commands:

### Basic Workflow:
```bash
# Check status of your files
git status

# Add files to staging
git add .                    # Add all changes
git add filename.ts          # Add specific file

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# View commit history
git log --oneline

# View changes in a file
git diff filename.ts
```

### Branching (Recommended for features):
```bash
# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Switch between branches
git checkout master
git checkout feature/new-feature

# Merge branch back to master
git checkout master
git merge feature/new-feature
```

```bash
# Add remote repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo-name.git

# Push to remote
git push -u origin master

# Pull from remote
git pull origin master
```

## Current Status:
